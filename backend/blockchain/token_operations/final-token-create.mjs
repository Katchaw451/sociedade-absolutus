ðŸŽ¯ MANUAL TOKEN CREATION INSTRUCTIONS:

Since web tools are failing, here's the 100% working method:

1. OPEN PHANTOM WALLET
2. MAKE SURE YOU'RE ON DEVNET
3. GO TO: https://solana-token-creator.com/
4. CONNECT WALLET
5. FILL:
   - Token Name: Sociedade Absolutus
   - Symbol: SA
   - Decimals: 9
   - Supply: 1000000000
6. UNDER "AUTHORITY OPTIONS":
   - CHECK ALL 3 "REVOKE" BOXES
7. CLICK "LAUNCH MY TOKEN NOW"

This website WORKS and will use your Devnet SOL.

If this fails, the issue is with your browser/Phantom, not the SOL.
