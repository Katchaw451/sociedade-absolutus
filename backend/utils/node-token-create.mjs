ðŸ”§ LAST RESORT OPTION:

If NO websites work, we can create the token using Node.js directly.

But for this, you would need to:
1. Export your Phantom wallet private key
2. Run a Node.js script

However, this is more complex and less secure.

RECOMMENDATION:
Try https://solana-token-creator.com/ first - it's the most reliable.

Your 5 SOL are definitely on Devnet. The issue is the token creator websites
having technical problems or RPC issues.

Wait a few hours and try again, or try different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Brave).
